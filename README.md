# Utah-Water-Features
Welcome to my Tethys App!
This is a tethys application I developed to learn and practice working with the tethys platform. It implements a map with a WMS and GeoJSON layer. 


The WMS layer highlights rivers and streams throughout Utah.


The GeoJSON layer highlights reservoirs throughout Utah. Users can select each reservoir and see info on it, along with a time series of the reservoir's
water levels over the past year. 


This project is inspired by my love of visiting and exploring the reservoirs of Utah with my wife, Teresa.
